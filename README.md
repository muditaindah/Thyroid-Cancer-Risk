# Thyroid-Cancer-Risk
I’m working on a project to predict thyroid cancer risk using a dataset I found on Kaggle. The dataset includes a whopping 212,691 pieces of data covering a variety of thyroid cancer risk factors. It has info like demographics, clinical history, lifestyle habits, and key thyroid hormone levels, all of which help estimate the likelihood of thyroid cancer. This data could be super useful for building machine learning models that predict the risk based on different indicators.

I’ve tried out a few models to see which one works best for this kind of analysis.

Quick note: This classification model takes a general approach to predictions, but diving deeper into specific groups like gender or country might give more meaningful insights.
