# Thyroid-Cancer-Risk
I’m working on a project to predict thyroid cancer risk using a dataset I found on Kaggle. The dataset includes a massive 212,691 patient records, covering a range of thyroid cancer risk factors. It has details like demographics, clinical history, lifestyle habits, and key thyroid hormone levels, all of which help estimate the likelihood of thyroid cancer. This data could be really useful for building machine learning models that predict the risk based on various indicators.

I’ve tested a few models to figure out which one works best for this type of analysis.

Quick note: This classification model takes a general approach to predictions, but diving deeper into specific groups like gender or country might give more meaningful insights.
